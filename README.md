Regional analysis of CO₂ emission trends and fleet composition in UK road transport (2015–2024).

# Regional CO₂ Emission Trends and Fleet Composition Analysis in UK Road Transport (2015–2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyses regional and temporal trends in CO₂ emissions from UK road transport between 2015 and 2024.  
It examines how fleet composition (cars, LGVs, HGVs, buses, motorcycles) influences emission patterns across regions and evaluates potential future emission trajectories.

The study integrates open government datasets from the UK Department for Transport (DfT) and the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) to support evidence-based transport decarbonisation analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyse regional CO₂ emission trends in UK road transport (2015–2024)
- Examine the impact of fleet composition on total emissions
- Develop forecasting models for future emissions
- Simulate policy-relevant scenarios such as partial electrification of vehicle fleets


## Methods
- Data preprocessing and integration (DfT & NAEI)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression analysis on fleet composition and emissions
- Time series forecasting (ARIMA / Prophet)
- Scenario simulation and visualisation

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Prophet)
- Jupyter Notebook


## Data and Ethics
All datasets used in this project are publicly available and aggregated.  
No personal or sensitive data is included.
